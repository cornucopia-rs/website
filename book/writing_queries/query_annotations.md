# Query annotations
Query annotations decorate a SQL statement and describe the name, parameters and returned row columns of the query.

At their most basic, they look like this

```sql
--! authors_from_country
SELECT id, name, age 
FROM Authors 
WHERE Authors.nationality = :country;
```
The `--!` token indicates a Cornucopia query annotation, and `authors_from_country` is the name of the query.

Cornucopia will actually prepare your queries against your schema, automatically finding the parameters, row columns and their respective types. That is why in most simple queries, you don't have to specify the parameters or row columns: only the query name is required.

That said, you can also go further than this simple syntax in order to customize your queries, as you will learn in the next sections 

```admonish note
Query annotations are declared with this token: `--!`
```

## Nullity

By default, parameters and returned row columns will all be inferred as non-null. If you want to control their nullity, you can use the question mark (`?`) syntax:
```sql
--! authors_from_country (country?) : (age?)
SELECT id, name, age 
FROM Authors 
WHERE Authors.nationality = :country;
```
The `(country?)` and `(age?)` annotations mean that the parameter `country` and returned column `age` will be inferred as nullable (`Option` in Rust). 

```admonish note
Use a colon (`:`) to separate bind parameters from row columns (both are optional, only the query name is required).
```

You can also granularly modify the nullity of composites and arrays like so:
```sql
--! example_query : (compos?.some_field?, arr?[?])
SELECT compos, arr 
FROM example 
```
which means that the `compos` column and its field `some_field` are both nullable and that the `arr` column and its elements are also nullable.
