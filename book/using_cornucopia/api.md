# API
Cornucopia's API offers functionalities similar to the CLI. The main benefit of the API over the CLI is to facilitate programmatic use cases and expose useful abstractions (e.g. an error type).

For more information, you can read the library API [docs](https://docs.rs/crate/cornucopia/latest).
